# **THE MUSICAL DICE**

## The Original Idea

### Historical Background

A *Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel* (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using dice to randomly 'generate' music from precomposed options. These 'games' were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different games were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely 'choosing a random number.'

The way these games work may be understood in analogy to sentence construction.

| n   | A         | B      | C       | D          |
| --- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- |
| 1   | The cow   | ran    | past    | the field. |
| 2   | The pig   | walked | through | the yard.  |
| 3   | The sheep | ran    | into    | the marsh. |

One rolls one die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 2 3 1 3 one is given, "*The pig ran past the marsh.*" Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight variations rather than being entirely different.

## My Idea

- Fragments are 2 bars long rather than 1.
- All the music was composed by me.

(Selected in blue an example of a possible outcome)

Any end of any of the columns works musically well with the beginning of the following column, so each throw of the dice will create a different piece of music every time (albeit harmonically similar).
